The bnsrc library has a .mod for BN247.scr and BN247PD but they don't 
appear to have any custom code. Nothing turns up when you compare them.

The scr.mod is a duplicate of version 10 of the scr from March 2014.
The PD.mod is also version 10 from March 2014 as far as I can tell.
The PD has been compiled in prod since Oct 2020. It is version 12 of the code.

Comparing the files, there isn't any custom code in there to be seen.
There are some stray displays but I believe those were actually left
in there by Lawson.

tl;dr
Cataloged version of the files is .scr version 10, PD version 12, which
has been compiled in prod since 10/2020. There is very likely no custom
code in the program.
